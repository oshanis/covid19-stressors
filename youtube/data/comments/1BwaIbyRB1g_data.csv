"You are a brainwashed moron and I can prove it . 1)You believe that

planets most sophisticated defence system and two planes made 3
buildings (dont forget building 7 like the commission report did)
collapse at free fall speed and dustify everything , leave pools of
molton steel and have a paper passport magically found in the dust .
2) You believe Bill Gates is a good guy who gives millions to charity
( that is peanuts to him and it pails against the billions he is
going to make from his magic vaccine that by the way not only
contains aborted human fetal tissue , toxins , but as a free bonus
this time will contain HYPER GEL with sensors to track and monitor
c/o D.A.R.P.A. ) Here‚Äôs a fact : NAUGHTY
BILLY forgot to tell you what the vaccine insert 13 says for every
vaccine :""THIS VACCINE HAS NOT BEEN TESTED FOR CARCINOGENIC
POTENTIAL , MUTAGENIC POTENTIAL AND IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY "" In
basic English If you get CANCER , TERMINAL ILLNESS THROUGH GENE
MUTATION OR CANNOT HAVE BABIES as a direct result of Billy's little
vaccine . There is legally nothing you can do .Billy gets his
billions and reduces population double wammy ! You dont think he
wants to ? ‚ÄúThe
world today has 6.8 billion people. That's heading up to about nine
billion. Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care
& reproductive health services, we could LOWER that by perhaps 10

Don‚Äôt trust me watch the TED TALK . Listen I could go on forever
but here‚Äôs the deal :There is a video that has been banned /
deleted  by youtube and vimeo . You need to ask yourself 3 questions
1)
Why
are they so scared people see it if it doesn‚Äôt credibly
threaten their narrative?
2)
Am I A PATHETIC SCARED CHILD IN ADULT SKIN who needs to be protected
by big brother and told what I am allowed or not allowed to watch? 3)
Am I a free thinking curious adult open to both sides of the story ?
You can‚Äôt turn back now you have a choice BE A RESPONSIBLE  ADULT
OR A PATHETIC SUBSERVIENT  BABY . Be careful now 
one of these choices will lead to regret , tears pain and suffering
of millions the other will help avoid it . You
have been warned Are you really prepared to gamble that
I am not doing God‚Äôs work and and that instead  I am just a
‚Äúconspiracy nutter‚Äù

all that was needed was a few minutes of your life ? This
could well be the most important decision of your life.WORD
