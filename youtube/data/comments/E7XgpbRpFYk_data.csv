It needs to be an all online process why the hell do you have to call after filing online. Been trying since March 18th no one picks up or you finally get through you enter your info then it tells you to hold and not even a second later it says all claim specialists are busy and it hangs up on you it doesnt even put you on hold to wait for someone it's so dumb.,-0.9009,4

I was almost done online until the site crashed and I couldn't log back in. I finally completed my claim application on the phone via automaton. My information is on file but apparently I have to speak to a claims representative (human) to begin recieving my benefits. No such luck! Hopefully I'll get retroactive benefits along with the enhanced benefits when it finally goes through as I lost work due to virus related state mandated shutdown.,0.923,2

By not requireing those who did the application online to call in order to complete the claim would have been HUGE in relieving the issue. They failed. This all could have been handled much better.,0.6289,2
Guess what people the governor is not telling you there are too many people applying for this insurance and they do not have the money to pay you they are I just dragging their feet they do not have the funds but this many people to file all at one time the money is not there,-0.0516,5
You can file a claim all you want on a good day they refuse to pick up the phone for days you put your information on the internet and wait and wait and wait. And then you try to call them that's when the fun starts no one ever picks up the phone and that is in good times you can kiss your money goodbye there is no money no one is picking up the phone you could file online good luck with that and if your password gets locked out there's no one to call to get unlocked out don't count on that money you will not receive it we are waiting here in New York City way before the virus I did not even get an answer from these people they are lazy and they don't work,0.765,4
Nothing in the report about changing the phone system to a call back system?  Why not ask the obvious question.  This isn't technology rocket science all they need to do is create a list of numbers that call and call them back in order.  Maybe it takes days or weeks to get a call back but at least it will happen in order and people don't have to spend all day for weeks dialing a number they know won't work.  Do better with questions on why they are not changing the system.  Just adding more operators is not the solution.,-0.5502,11
