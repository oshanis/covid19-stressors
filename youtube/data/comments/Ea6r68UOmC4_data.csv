Nothing in the report about changing the phone system to a call back system?  Why not ask the obvious question.  This isn't technology rocket science all they need to do is create a list of numbers that call and call them back in order.  Maybe it takes days or weeks to get a call back but at least it will happen in order and people don't have to spend all day for weeks dialing a number they know won't work.

"*Temporary measures are **_not_** repealed.* Citizens cannot anticipate the changes that will take place in their lives. The _escape_ in travel that people take for granted has been curtailed. Jets account for 7% of airborne pollution. Jets and other modes of transportation consume much oxygen and the level of oxygen is dropping.

That is a reflection of the increasing number of living corpses decades past normal life expectancy in whom _rigor mortis_ is prevented by modern medicine.

"Last week, Mayor Kenney of Philadelphia said the city doesn't have the time or money to continue negotiating with Hahnemann's owner, to use a vacant, decommissioned HOSPITAL to treat COVID-19 patients.

Instead, patients will be treated on the floor of the Liacouras Center, a sports and music venue offered up by Temple University. While hospitals are being nationalized in Spain and Ireland in response to this crisis, Philadelphia is worried about angering a real estate speculator who couldn't find a productive use for the building in half a year.

We CANNOT afford to sit around and wait for our hospitals to be overwhelmed by this pandemic while Hahnemann remains vacant; the city needs to do whatever it takes to bring Hahnemann under public control now.

The coronavirus crisis has exposed the complete inadequacy of our for-profit healthcare system. After the COVID-19 pandemic is behind us, Hahnemann University Hospital must be kept open and run as a public city hospital, funded through taxes on the top 3% of corporations in Philadelphia.

City Hall should challenge big moneyed interests, and we need to let them know!
