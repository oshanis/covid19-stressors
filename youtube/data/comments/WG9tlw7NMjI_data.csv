Nothing in the report about changing the phone system to a call back system?  Why not ask the obvious question.  This isn't technology rocket science all they need to do is create a list of numbers that call and call them back in order.  Maybe it takes days or weeks to get a call back but at least it will happen in order and people don't have to spend all day for weeks dialing a number they know won't work.

"*Temporary measures are **_not_** repealed.* Citizens cannot anticipate the changes that will take place in their lives. The _escape_ in travel that people take for granted has been curtailed. Jets account for 7% of airborne pollution. Jets and other modes of transportation consume much oxygen and the level of oxygen is dropping.

That is a reflection of the increasing number of living corpses decades past normal life expectancy in whom _rigor mortis_ is prevented by modern medicine.

"Last week, Mayor Kenney of Philadelphia said the city doesn't have the time or money to continue negotiating with Hahnemann's owner, to use a vacant, decommissioned HOSPITAL to treat COVID-19 patients.

Instead, patients will be treated on the floor of the Liacouras Center, a sports and music venue offered up by Temple University. While hospitals are being nationalized in Spain and Ireland in response to this crisis, Philadelphia is worried about angering a real estate speculator who couldn't find a productive use for the building in half a year.

We CANNOT afford to sit around and wait for our hospitals to be overwhelmed by this pandemic while Hahnemann remains vacant; the city needs to do whatever it takes to bring Hahnemann under public control now.

The coronavirus crisis has exposed the complete inadequacy of our for-profit healthcare system. After the COVID-19 pandemic is behind us, Hahnemann University Hospital must be kept open and run as a public city hospital, funded through taxes on the top 3% of corporations in Philadelphia.

City Hall should challenge big moneyed interests, and we need to let them know!

But in regards going out looking for work at such places mentioned of "" *Amazon, CVS & Walmart* "" who are hiring, what the news here is not reporting is "" *Amazon & Walmart* "" had already confirmed cases of the Coronavirus that have been confirmed through their employees that was positive for the Coronavirus. I do not know if employees of "" *CVS* "" have been confirmed with the Coronavirus as I have not heard of any but a simple Google check, I am sure would identity if there was. Another thing many are not covering is not only can this Coronavirus  stay on counters at such at cash registers for a short time but paper absorbs moisture meaning in could absorb fluids from a fever discharging from out bodies or sweat for example. 

Cash money is made of paper. So money can actually hold this Coronavirus through the moisture from our skin through sweat from fevers or regular sweat. This money goes in our pockets & purses having containment there. Then we ALL utilize money weekly to purchase goods or services so cash money can flow through several cities and even cross country hand to hand really fast as banks also send money everywhere as well. So what I am getting at, say someone works at a "" *CVS, PIZZA & OR FOOD DELIVERY* "" how much money is going to flow through our hands during the course of employment at these places? Not everyone utilizes debit or credit cards. *OF COURSE PEOPLE LOOKING AT OBTAINING EMPLOYMENT AT THE PLACES NAMED ARE AT HIGH RISK JUST BY USING MONEY THEN TAKING THIS CORONAVIRUS BACK HOME FROM THE MONEY TO THEIR LOVED ONES OF OTHER ADULTS & CHILDREN FROM BABIES TO TEENAGERS AS WELL* .
