the drive-through a symbol of America's capitalist invention now being used to process its millions of unemployed Florida's online benefit system crashed under the demand so - in Arkansas where people are risking their health to come in person to the unemployment office can't get through so that's why I'm standing down here lying to go see them face to face as unemployed Americans feel they have no choice but to reject white house advice and physically apply for help the president is suggesting this will all be over soon we're hopefully heading toward a final stretch the light at the end of the tunnel try telling back to the frontline health workers of New York City it's really I mean yesterday I worked 16 hours and I had 13 cardiac arrests that's a lot of death a record 799 of them in the state yesterday nurses used to working in the worst of situations say they could never have imagined what they're now witnessing they're also a plethora of people who are just incredibly sick in a way that I've never experienced or seen before and it's awful to be able to offer them so minimum of things so every day is honestly the hardest day that anxiety is not lost on the state's governor his daily briefings as much about bolstering morale as imparting information we're in a battle right but this is about a war and we're only on one battle here even once we get through this battle we have to stay prepared for what could come down the road and we also have to start to repair the immense damage before you start talking about restarting the economy another necessity of vaccine that race continues a pace but but scientists say a widely available treatment is still at least a year away suggesting America's streets may be empty for much longer than the president predicts well earlier I spoke to doctor Seon Ferrell who is currently working as an emergency physician in New York but she also served as a medic in Iraq I began by asking her what she's seeing in the hospital she's now deployed what we see every day is overwhelming how you walk into the emergency department usually you have a waiting room outside the street with normal cars but now the street is filled with tents that are seeing patients and our waiting rooms have changed into a makeshift emergency room and our emergency department when you walk into the hallway you see people on oxygen it feels like you're an ICU because you see a lot of patients on a ventilator because they can't wait on their own doctor prayer you are used to the frontline you were in Iraq how does this contrast with a military medical operation is this the poor relation yes you know I've never seen this much dead in one day except when I was in Iraq and that I felt like I was more prepared for it because it was an active war zone and to see a lot of patients dying as something that you expect and you mentally prepared for but to see this and here in New York City where you'd expect to be practicing advanced medicine with resources and it's not only an active war zone but it feels like it's fighting against the virus the humanity component of it is almost gone because you're not having that touch everything is through masks and to a personal protective equipment you will have to tell family members say I'm sorry I can't let you see your mother or your father while they're dying but I'll promise you that I'll be by their side and make them comfortable this feels unbelievably hard on you on the nurses on the other doctors on all the orderlies I mean how do you deal with the stress some of us including myself have fallen ill due to this disease and I also brought at home and my husband also ill and having to fight the disease me as as a patient this time around and the issue with getting tested because testing was not abundantly available for most of us what we told patients are if you don't need to come to the hospital because you need excisional because you need to be on a ventilator don't come stay at home and when they do come and if they look fine or stable I've sent them home without tests it'd be just because we just didn't have enough testing for everyone so me being on the other side and saying and gaining that answer hey your symptoms are not severe enough so just stay home and take care of yourself and no we won't test you that for me was such a shocker because here I am in the front line and being told I being told that I couldn't get tested at the time when I felt ill I felt so unappreciated and felt so defeated from the whole process but as we speak now dr. Ferrer there is no obvious end in sight and I'm wondering how long you can put up how long you can cope with this stress we know that it's going to be few more weeks before New York and all the state can go back to normal and there might be few more months I'm hopeful that you know in the next six to eight weeks that the numbers are gonna start declining the plateau might be a few more weeks again but I think it's just really with the glimpse of hope and with the amount of support that we get from family members from France and some of the things that me and my colleagues talk about our like this every day at 7 p.m. all of New York City those out to the window and are clapping showing their appreciation for the frontline providers I found it very helpful and very uplifting and encouraging is such those house warming moments and makes it very honored to do the things that we do every day
