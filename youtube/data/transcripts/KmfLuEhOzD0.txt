new record last week was 6.6 million new claims if my next guess is correct we're about to break that record again this week so when can we expect this curve to crest joining me now is Jesse Edgerton from JP Morgan's economic and policy research team Jesse it's good to see you certainly caught a lot of attention last week with this forecast we're gonna hit 7 million new claims this week is this as bad as it's gonna get I would hope this might be as bad as it's going to get but it's hard to know for sure if you look at past really sharp events like September 11th or something like that the level of unemployment claims stayed elevated for something like four or five weeks right afterwards so we're just in the third week here on on this this event right now so if that's the case the 9/11 comparison is a relatively hopeful one there are a couple of things that are different this time one is that the unemployment benefits themselves come with a big incentive the extra $600 to try to help people get through does and and the wider way of people who can get them freelancers and gig economy workers for the first time how much are those factors you think increasing claims relative to what the economy itself would be generating well I mean honestly I think there are millions tens of millions of people that would be filing for benefits anyway even without these these extra incentives right you've got 12 million people to work a restaurant you've got another 10 million people that work in non-essential retail outside of grocery stores and pharmacies there's another 20 million people that work in non-essential manufacturing and construction so you know even without these kind of special factors right now there's there's easily tens of millions of people that are at risk of getting laid off right and you just I think see 12 - that's 32 million people right there you just referenced so if claims do hit seven million this week plus six and a half thirteen and a half oh is it before that three and a half that seventeen million so only about halfway through this thing do you think that's about right that might be a little bit on the pessimistic side right you know there's easily say 50 million jobs at risk from from the shutdowns here you know but we don't know we don't know exactly how many people are going to get laid off right we don't know if restaurants are going to layoff 50 percent of their employees or or 90 percent or or what you know I think we're gonna getting close - that that 50% level at this point so I would kind of hope that we slow down after that and obviously you know all of these forecasts are contingent on what happens with the coronavirus I'm curious if you think the claims is relatively tracking the coronavirus curve in real time or with a lag of a week or two any early indications there especially got a bit of a lag of probably a few weeks you know months ago we were tracking things like the movie box office numbers and a number of people riding the subway in New York and hotel occupancy and things like that so those things were already starting to plummet you know maybe four weeks ago and then we've just been getting the you know the claims numbers hid in kind of for the last two weeks here so I think the claims numbers are one of our most timely indicators but they were still a little bit behind these things that were kind of directly hit right away by the virus itself and what's your total forecast at this point for the number filed I mean I would guess we'll get to something like maybe 25 million here over that would be the sum over the last two weeks plus the next two or three something like that yeah and from there just then we'd like to see a drop as quickly as possible and continuing claims well yeah that you know there was a little bit of a puzzle last week where the entire rise and initial claims from the previous week didn't show up and can it in continuing claims you know I would kind of can get guess maybe that's just like a processing lag and we're going to see the vast majority of these initial claims show up as as continuing the claims at some point they're absolutely you
