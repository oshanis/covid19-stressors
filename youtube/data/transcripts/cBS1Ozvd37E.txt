-So, it's been one week
since I was laid off. -We're on furlough as of Monday. -I've been furloughed
for a few days now. -My first thought is going,
like, "I don't even know
where to start." -You go from feeling really
secure to really thinking about, "Oh, how I am gonna make
rent this month?" -There's no new paycheck coming
in for the next month's bills, and the bills aren't
gonna stop coming in. -It seems like everything that
was starting to look up for me and my family drastically changed within
one day with this pandemic. I've been in prison for a lot
of years of my life and been homeless for 2
1/2 years in New York. Caesars Entertainment
was the first place that actually had given me
a chance to gain employment. And I was supposed to start
Tuesday -- the next following Tuesday, which was the 16th
or the 17th of March. And everything shut down. -Since last month,
I started losing my hours because our ratio at the daycare
dramatically dropped with the new coronavirus
and stuff. So, a lot of parents were not bringing
their kids in and stuff, so a lot of teachers
were losing their hours. And two weeks ago -- Almost about three weeks ago,
my boss e-mailed us that he is shutting the daycare
down because of the new CDC law. So a lot of teachers,
including myself, we do not have jobs
at this point right now. -We would spend Tuesday
through Thursday morning rehearsing for the concerts
on Thursday night through Saturday night. So, I mean, our lives are four
or five rehearsals, three or four concerts a week. And we're doing nothing. Sometimes I'm like,
"I don't know what's going on. I just don't know
what's going on. Maybe Starbucks
is hiring after this." -It took me five hours
to file my claim that should have taken
about 25 minutes. It may not load, but it might. But it's been taking about
six to eight tries to get them to load. We'll continue. Okay.
Sorry. I have to sign in again. For now, North Carolina has
denied my unemployment claim for reasons I don't know yet. $0.
Wages -- $0. Benefit amount -- $0. I am trying not to just be sad,
but it's scary and stressful, because you don't know
how long you're gonna be able to pay your rent
or buy groceries. And right now,
my mom lives with me because she needs
a hip replacement. [voice breaking]
So it's super-stressful. -So, they're not
giving me anything. The state not
giving me anything. Nobody giving us anything. We're struggling.
There's nowhere to turn to. Backed up in rent. Cable bill, phone bill --
We're backed up in everything. -I am seven days late on rent. But it doesn't feel good. For someone who likes to be
on time with things and for someone who's usually
pretty on top of this stuff, to have moments like this where that's not able to be done
is unfortunate. So, in reality, though, I mean, I have another month's
worth of money until I hit zero. -It's kind of new
and very scary. And we're all struggling to
figure out what that even means, because in the orchestra world,
this just never happens. [violin playing] I practice when I can wrap
my head around it. It's hard enough to practice. It's hard enough
to get that focus. So, we're not furloughed
any longer, although we're
still not working. And we're gonna have some pretty
significant pay cuts, but at least there's
some certainty at least for a little while. And we're all really hoping that
we can just get back to work and get back to playing. -I do really miss waking up
in the morning and kind of having a set list
of tasks that I know
I need to get through. In the meantime, I have been
applying to a lot of jobs, kind of going back
to my educational background, which is more towards medicine
and medical research. -I'm looking for opportunities
just to do some freelance work where I can if I can
borrow equipment here and there. -I'm doing stuff kind of,
like, on the side. I started taking online
spin-instructor classes so that I can get
my certification by the end of the year, which was one
of my goals anyways. So, now I have the time
to do it. -I always try to look
at the positive. I'm a very optimistic person. And so I'm happy that I get
to be home with my son. I look at this -- I keep calling it, like,
a second maternity leave. Like, time for me to spend
some extra time with him. You just have to find some sort of way to be positive
through this whole thing. -Hopefully we all hang in there,
stay safe, and we all come out
of this soon, and it's just another moment
in the history to remember.
