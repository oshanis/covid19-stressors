listen Catherine what what is the European approach to jobless claims it and do you think a model like that could be coming here so the really interesting component is every country is doing it in a different way and that's kind of a bit of a problem frankly and that's why we're seeing so much haste on the European side meaning to say in Brussels through Brussels to try to come up with something that would be a certain entry European mechanism I think the most generous countries right now they're trying to shore up their labor market certainly our Germany and Denmark Germany has a scheme that it has built over time I has a rainy day fund of about 26 billion euros to shore up particularly labor markets through a very specifically German scheme called short work which is to say that the the government covers about 60% 67% if you have a child of the income you're not making or you're being reduced from making through your corporations and the idea is similar idea in Denmark to is that you're gonna reduce the costs for hiring a rehiring if you were to lay people off right so idea that you're gonna support both your workers so that you create more fidelity if you will to companies you're gonna let companies come back get back on line faster and the country is gonna shoulder the burden for that and now estimates go it's gonna eat up probably half of that rainy day fund but that's some German government put in place after the financial crisis yeah and like you said a lot of people said Germany bounce back rapidly from the crisis because of this short work system but I wonder if it comes at the cost of flexibility I mean the real reason that they have it is because in Germany it's really hard to lay people off it's a very highly regulated labour market do we really want America to be going down that road well I mean first and foremost you're not gonna get the same situation in the United States as you are in Germany or even in Europe we have a totally different system of sort of social welfare and transfer payments for the German economy of course that makes sense because if you think about were the bulk items in the German economy they're machine building their automobiles there are big time in fact during jobs and even as we look ahead around like what could the next three months of recovery post reopening in about two or three months look like sectors that are likely gonna benefit or gonna be able to come back online are those sectors service economies like the UK or even large parts of the United States are gonna be hit much harder because of the percentage that services are in this economy or the UK Steve let me ask you what lasting changes you think we might experience to the way that we do jobless benefits in this country from first the financial crisis and now the pandemic yeah well first of all I just want to say I actually went over to Germany and did a story on this kurz our bot which is this shortened workweek and I don't think there's anything about implementing this in a downturn that would limit flexibility I guess it would limit flexibility of workers to move to another sector on the way back but the question becomes in a downturn if you want them to remain attached to their existing workplace and ease the burden of rehiring them and get a quicker start so that's one question I think Kelly that we're gonna rethink our entire social safety net system you see what's happening now even the astonishing numbers that we have on jobless claims are low because of the inability of states to process them the unemployment claims is our first line of defense out here Congress had to raise that amount and there's a debate about how how much it raised it there's a debate about whether or not the Fed should have to come in this is the second time around Kelly the Fed has had to come in and completely backstop the financial system although of course the banks are doing better now but other parts of the system or not so I think when we have a chance to catch our breath we're gonna go back and take a look at the social safety net take a look at what the feds proper role here is and why once again it has to come in and backstop the financial system Kathryn what do you think you know if we're in the in the luxury of being able to pluck what works and Chuck what doesn't what what should we pluck here in the US for the future well I do think that it's critical to have a some sort of baxter some sort of employment back is absolutely critical because again what are the costs we've already needed to do it what are the cost of rehiring those are enormous right retiring retraining repositioning within the economy and we in the United States don't have a full unit or comprehensive view of what that actually means and how that might further derail or slowdown economic growth in this country so to have that sort of backstop I think long term because again you know we're going to inevitably face some version of global shock as we go forward and we need to restore trust within our financial systems and one way to do that is to have that insurance policy but then also to work in two different directions we already talked out and talked about it we need that medical solution but again we need to ensure that our companies can get back to work and we need to do that for those backstops and to do it through the government and before I let you go Steve since you kind of said there that we have to rethink our entire social safety net system what else are you hearing that might be part of that rethink well I mean look at what the Fed is trying to do right now it's trying to create this Main Street Landing Facility I've been reporting on this all day a series of enormous enormous challenges to the Federal Reserve both from the stipulations in the Kerr's Act but also that kind of conflict with the feds general way of operating which is not to take losses who will backstop a Main Street who will backstop private business in these situations and what's a way to get this money out more quickly to the individuals and help them out in the event of a sudden shock like this I think there's a lot of things to think about here I do think we're doing pretty good given the state of the system before we went into this all right thank you both we appreciate it
